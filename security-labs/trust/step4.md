All images in Docker Hub under the **library** organization (currently viewable at: https://hub.docker.com/explore/) are deemed "Official Images." These images undergo a rigorous, [open-source](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/) review process to ensure they follow best practices. These best practices include signing, being lean, and having clearly written Dockerfiles. For these reasons, it is strongly recommended that you use official images whenever possible.

Official images can be pulled with just their name and tag. You do not have to precede the image name with ``library/`` or any other repository name.
